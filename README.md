# Wacko Words NFT Front-End

This is the front-end code for the Wacko Words NFT.

Wacko Words NFTS are absurd three-word combo NFTs; their meanings depend on what you make of them ;-).

Once you connect your wallet, you can mint up to three snazzy Wacko Words NFTs for free; you'll also be able to see how many have been minted so far - there are a hundred up for grabs! Word combinations and background colors will be randomly gererated upon mint.

Once minted to your wallet, you will receive a message with a link to your NFT on Opensea. It may take a short while for it to appear on the site. In the meantime, you can also check out the collection of current mints on Opensea.

Wacko Words NFT lives on Ethereum's Rinkeby Test Network. Never send real Eth to your testnet address. If you did, you would lose it. [Testnets](https://medium.com/compound-finance/the-beginners-guide-to-using-an-ethereum-test-network-95bbbc85fc1d) use test Eth which you can get for free from [Chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby) or other faucets. It is recommended that you create a separate wallet for use on test networks.
